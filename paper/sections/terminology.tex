\section{Terminology} \label{s:terminology}
The name of the project, which encompasses the entire research scope of this work, is ``Dimensionally Reduced Adversarial Generations on Networks Filtered by Integrated Static Transformations'' which is shortened to Project DRAGONFIST.

Each model and filter combination is referred to as a ``Classification Worker'' (CLAW). The only parameters for CLAWs are the choice of filter as well as optional feature-wise preprocessing applied to the filtered dataset.

The ensembled model, composed of a set of CLAWs, is named the ``Final Intuition Stage'' (FIST). The model trained on the training set augmented with filtered versions of the training images is called the "Package Aggregate Learning Model" (PALM)
